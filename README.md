# Shiplee - Shipping App (Internship task)

A modern, feature-rich shipping app built with Flutter that allows users to compare shipping rates from multiple couriers, book shipments, and track orders in real-time.

## ⚠️ Important: Setup Order
This project consists of two parts that must be set up in the correct order:
1. **Backend Server** (Must be set up and running first)
2. **Flutter App** (Set up after backend is running)

## Features

- **Courier Comparison**: Compare shipping rates from multiple courier services
- **Shipment Booking**: Easy package details entry and address selection

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter, Dart
- **State Management**: Riverpod
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: SQLite

## Prerequisites

1. Install Flutter:
   - Download Flutter SDK from [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
   - Add Flutter to your PATH
   - Run `flutter doctor` and fix any issues

2. Install Node.js:
   - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
   - Verify installation: `node --version` and `npm --version`

3. Install Android Studio:
   - Download from [developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com/studio)
   - Install Flutter and Dart plugins
   - Set up an Android emulator

## Step 1: Backend Setup (Do This First!)

1. Navigate to backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd shipping_app/backend
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment:
   ```bash
   # Create .env file
   echo "PORT=5000" > .env
   ```

4. Initialize database:
   ```bash
   npm run setup-sqlite
   ```

5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Verify backend is running:
   - Open browser to `http://localhost:5000`
   - You should see "Server is running"
   - Keep this terminal window open

## Step 2: Flutter App Setup

Open a new terminal window and:

1. Return to project root:
   ```bash
   cd shipping_app
   ```

2. Set up Android SDK configuration:
   - Copy the template file:
     ```bash
     cp android/local.properties.template android/local.properties
     ```
   - Edit `android/local.properties` with your SDK paths:
     ```properties
     # Windows paths (use double backslashes)
     sdk.dir=C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk
     flutter.sdk=C:\\dev\\flutter

     # macOS/Linux paths
     # sdk.dir=/Users/YourUsername/Library/Android/sdk
     # flutter.sdk=/Users/YourUsername/flutter
     ```

3. Get Flutter dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"Cannot connect to backend" Error**:
   - Ensure you started the backend server FIRST
   - Backend must be running before starting the Flutter app
   - Check if backend is running on `http://localhost:5000`

2. **Database Errors**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   rm -rf database/shipping_app.db
   npm run setup-sqlite
   ```

3. **Android SDK Not Found**: 
   - Verify paths in `android/local.properties`
   - Ensure Android Studio is properly installed

4. **API Connection Issues**: 
   The app uses different URLs based on platform:
   - Android Emulator: `http://10.0.2.2:5000`
   - iOS Simulator: `http://localhost:5000`
   - Web: `http://localhost:5000`
